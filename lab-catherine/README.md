# Lab 03: Parallel File Processing

In reader.js the exported module is an object with the textReader.readText function attached. The function has an arity of two (paths and callback). Paths is an array of filepaths to .txt files. Callback is the callback function which is sending the content of the array of .txt files. To return an array of strings containing the contents of the three text files, the three filepaths passed in the array must be valid. If those three filepaths are invalid, then an error object will be returned.
